# What is egghead.io?

egghead.io is a website dedicated to providing high quality, concise web development screencasts. Our primary mission is to help make the web a better place for us all. We've got a deep love for open-source software and the communities that surround the work being done in that area. Like many people reading this, we owe so much to the efforts of the amazing humans that contribute to open-source software every single day.

An egghead.io screencast is different from other screencasts. We don't like long drawn out lectures. This means that we keep it concise, with minimal "fluff". Somebody watching egghead.io screencasts is busy, and we respect their time very much.

We prefer to show instead of tell. This means that egghead instructors strive to demonstrate, and avoid long periods where they talk at you. Instead they are doing and building, explaining along the way.

An egghead.io lesson focuses on the code. That's what people are here to see. We teach by doing, and egghead lessons don't contain PowerPoint slides filled with bullet points.

Our mission is to make programmers **badass**. :punch:

## Who are egghead instructors?

Doers.

We're always looking for interesting humans that are doing interesting things in web development. What is an "interesting thing"? For us this has been a wide range of activities.

We are web developers first. This means that we work hard to stay informed of modern patterns and practices on a daily basis. To do so, it means paying attention, reading industry currents through blogs, Github Issues, StackOverflow questions and answers, Reddit, Twitter, and any other nook and cranny we can find on the internet.

One common trait all of these channels share is a sub-population of truly helpful, kind, generous, and hard-working individuals that make a difference every single day. These people might be seasoned industry veterans, they might just be starting out their career, or anything in between. They write thoughtful comments, contribute to documentation and/or code, write useful blog posts, answer questions in a caring way...

That's who we want teaching on egghead.io

If this sounds like you, keep reading. We are here to help you become an egghead instructor. We will tell you all of our "secrets", provide feedback, and guide you along the way to getting your first lesson published.




# becoming an instructor

egghead.io instructors are invited to instruct. If you know somebody that would make an awesome instructor, please let them know on Twitter or send an email. If you CC [`@eggheadio`](https://twitter.com/eggheadio) or [`support@egghead.io`](mailto:support@egghead.io) we will always take a look and respond. Be sure to include a link to some example work. Blog posts, videos, open-source projects, etc...


## What to expect when you're invited to egghead

If you have been invited to egghead.io you should receive an email with a link to create an instructor profile. The instructor profile doesn't become public until you've published a lesson, but it does allow you full and free access to all egghead.io lessons and courses. This includes pre-release content! This access is for life, with no strings attached.

## The contributor contract

Along with the instructor profile, you will be asked to review, and e-sign our standard instructor contract. You can take a look at it here, and review it with your lawyer if you'd like. We are more than happy to discuss custom contracts for special circumstances, but we've gone out of our way to present a contract that protects you fully as a content producer.

## Joining Slack

Once you have created an instructor profile, you will receive an invitation to our Slack channel. It's a great room where we discuss all things related to web development, and enjoy banter with lots of interesting humans. Much like your lifetime PRO access to egghead content, your access to the Slack room is for life as well. We've got a general code of conduct that we ask all participants to follow, but we haven't had any (and don't expect to have any) issues in that regard. It's a warm safe place filled with lots of kind and helpful people like yourself 😄




# You're invited to teach on egghead.io

Congrats! :tada:

We are excited to work with you and help teach people how to become better programmers.

There are a few things that we want to let you know to get started. You aren't on your own, we are here to help as much as possible. To be your concierge, and eliminate as much pain as possible from the process of creating awesome bite-sized video tutorials on egghead.io.

You should have received two things. An invitation to the egghead Slack chat, and a link to set up your instructor profile on egghead.io. If you haven't received either of those, be sure to contact whoever invited you and ask them "what's up?"

It is likely that the person that invited you to teach on egghead.io will also be your **mentor** and primary point of contact as you work towards getting your first lessons and courses published.

> If you weren't invited to teach on egghead.io, continue reading! Follow the guidelines, review existing lessons, and record an "audition". Post that to YouTube, and tweet [@eggheadio](https://twitter.com/eggheadio). 

## Your Mentor

egghead.io doesn't have an open call for submissions for lessons. This means that you were invited by somebody to create a lesson. The person that invited you is **your mentor** (or will introduce you to your mentor)

## Instructor Profile

Your invitation link should take you to the form so that you can create an instructor profile and an egghead.io account if you don't have one. 

Creating your instructor profile will give you **lifetime access to egghead.io free of charge**.

Your instructor profile is not public until you've published your first lesson. 

## Slack Channel

We love Slack, and our channel is an amazing mix of developers from around the globe. It is open to egghead instructors and people working on getting lessons published on egghead.

There are several chats available. We're just going to talk about a few real quick so that you can get your bearings when you land!

### egghead-chat

This is the "water cooler" and general discussion area. When you enter the chat for the first time, please introduce yourself and maybe provide a link to something that you work on or the spot where you blog on the internet.

The general chat can be a little noisy, so you might want to adjust your notification and do-not-disturb settings in Slack to match your preferences. 

The general chat is free to discuss anything you are interested in. We've got a [code of conduct]() that we ask all participants in the Slack channel to respect.

> **TODO** code of conduct for slack

### egghead-instructors

This room is meant to discuss the craft and act of creating **bite-sized code videos**. When an instructor uploads a new lesson, it is announced in this chat.

### egghead-lesson-ideas

There are so many things to teach about in the world of web development. When we see something interesting or get a request, it gets dropped in here. If you can't think of anything to record a lesson about, ask in here with `@joel`. I've almost always got something :simple_smile:!

## The example.

We are going to start with the example. The example is important, because it is the basis of creating a quality egghead lesson. The example will take the tool or technique you want to demonstrate, and inform the best way to get there.

You will work with your mentor to solidify the theme, scope, and goals of an example. This example will serve as the basis for your first egghead lesson.

### Where to start?

We need a theme. We need a pain. Some useful concept we can share with other developers. Think of this like "hey, check this out" to a friend or coworker about some tool, trick, or technique you've used to get the job done.

This is the gold! 💰

Ask your mentor and read [this section](../02-creating-lessons/ideas.md) about figuring out the core concept for your first example.

### Where to stop?

On the other side of the coin, we need to determine where to stop! Knowing where to stop is determined by the scope of the lesson you are trying to teach.

At egghead, we strive for _laser focus_ on concepts. This is what is meant when we say "bite-sized" lessons. We want individual lessons to be as concise and as focused as possible, while showing the viewer all of the steps required.

This means that you should be practical and thorough, respecting the viewers time, as well as your own.

> "Is this more than one concept or idea?"

Ask this question and discuss it with your mentor.

### Iterate on the example

Most examples should work in a tool like [Plunkr](https://plnkr.co/), our preferred tool for iterating on the first example. If the requirements of your topic are more complex we should discuss the scope and goals of the example and determine if we can simplify it. If it just can't be done on Plunkr, a Github repository will be used.

We will keep it simple! There is a reason the TODO list is such a popular example. It is "lame" and you might be bored of it, but simple examples \(especially more common examples\) are excellent for teaching. The more complex the example application, the more nuanced the **domain concerns** and the more time we have to spend covering that.

If we work towards simplicity, and not put too much effort into creating a novel and fun example, we actually do a service for our viewers by maximising their learning efforts. We focus them on the concept we want them to learn, and more effectively cement it in their brain.

**Small, high quality examples, in great frequency.**

This is what we are striving for at egghead.

Take notes as you build the example, and get a rough working draft of the code and concept as quickly as possible. We are striving for "it works" so that you can share and get feedback from your mentor as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the draft done, share it over screen sharing technology with your mentor. Walk them through the steps it took to create the example. You should listen to your mentor's questions and take notes where appropriate.

This will be a great time to brainstorm for ideas, and discuss more lessons that could be created with your example.

Don't be surprised if the scope of your example is cut back. Knowing what to leave out is a challenge, and we will aggressively work towards that conciseness that we crave at egghead. The lesson should cover one topic, and one topic only. No more, no less.

### **Choose a title and write a summary**

Now that the example is in a good state, it's time to choose a title. Here's a formula for writing good titles.

In your head \(or out loud. Go nuts!\) say the phrase "How do I..."

_Update ref attributes._

And then add the appropriate technology to the end such as "in React component." So "how do I..."

_Update ref attributes in React components_ becomes the title of the lesson. This focuses the action on what the viewer should learn, and the title clearly defines the scope for the example you will teach. "I want to...", "can I...", or other phrases would work here too!

Now you want to write a quick summary. Think of the short block of text you see under a link when you are searching on Google. Literally think of that exact box, because the summary is for that space! 2-3 sentences that describe what we will learn in your lesson.

The summary and title aren't set in stone, we can iterate on those too, so don't worry. We aren't striving for perfection.

## Your First Lesson Video

Making _anything_ is an accomplishment. Creating screencasts is hard. It's a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.

Totally normal!

It also \(thankfully\) fades over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.

For a draft lesson, we aren't looking for polish. We want to see something quick and rough.

### A very rough draft.

Imagine that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.

Would you make them a Power Point presentation?

Would you read from a script?

Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually **show them what you've built**, and why it is interesting?

That's what we are looking for with an draft lesson. You've built a cool example, let's take a look at it. Tell us how you built it, and what makes it interesting.

For now, don't worry about audio or video quality. We will send you professional audio recording gear and explain the technical details about recording screencasts later on.

Make mistakes! This might be new, and screencasting is most certainly a learned skill that gets easier with practice. This isn't a live presentation, and this draft won't be shared with the world.

Mistakes are fine. We will need to restart, cough, kids will run through, train will roll by, you name it, it happens to everybody.

**Just pause.**

Pause, and repeat where you were interrupted. Pauses are SO easy to edit out, and you should feel free to use them. **Pause a lot.**. Take a deep breath. Speak with confidence! You _are_ the expert.

Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.

### Upload Your Lesson

Now that the draft is complete, share it with your mentor using Slack. Ask your mentor to screen share with you for the editing process, so that you can get some guidance as needed for the first pass. This can save **hours** trying to figure things out.

Your mentor knows what we are looking for!

## Getting Paid

egghead.io instructors receive royalties for their lessons. :moneybag:

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30 second segments **subscribers** watched of your lessons in the previous month. We use PayPal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

The amount you are paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30 second segments were watched in total.

``` ruby
egghead_monthly_revenue * ( your_segments / total_segments ) * royalty_percent
```

This is the basic algorithm.

It can range from "lunch money" to "paying the bills!", and varies mostly based on your catalog of lessons. Producing courses takes the most effort, but they also make the most money for instructors.

In general we favor the approach of making interesting and useful content versus min/maxing the numbers to squeeze the most dollars out of the content. We don't produce sponsored content or run ads on a regular basis.

## Making Money Online

The course is the bread and butter of egghead.io. It's what people ultimately want to see. People absolutely crave _curation_. That's what an egghead.io course **is**: curated knowledge.

We provide that, and developers have proven that they are willing to pay for it. When you first start out making an egghead.io lesson or two, the royalties are... small. One off lessons float down and are more difficult to find. Developers looking to learn want curated chunks of information. One-off lessons are **still awesome** and have a very very long tail. They get picked up in Google searches and our own site search as well.

Our Angular 1 content is still huge believe it or not, and a lot of that is from one-offs that John made early on. But we know it is frustrating to work so hard on something (the first several screencasts are **super freaking hard** to make) and then see it fall flat to a slow trickle of revenue.

![revenue to published content correlation](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/331g2M3j0b2D1H02390k/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-29%20at%203.33.38%20PM.png?v=5aac1ea6)

Obviously making more content means making more royalties, but the chart also shows a strong correlation to courses and fat royalty checks 💰

Many people create a lesson or two, and then stop. You see that in the first third of the chart. There are a variety of reasons people don't keep making lessons:

* Way too freaking busy!
* It just isn't for them.
* It's hard af.
* Can't think of what to record.
* There's no real money in it.

All of these are completely valid, and we don't run a business that actively tries to pressure or extract extensive commitments from instructors. That said, we also want to eliminate barriers and provide a platform for you to share your expertise, help people make better careers through knowledge, and get everybody paid in the process.

Let's focus on the last one here for a minute. Getting paid.

One of the primary motivations for starting and building egghead.io has always been to provide reliable recurring income for smart humans that want to share knowledge with other humans. This kind of income has so much potential. It changes the entire landscape of how you might view employment in general. If you're making $1000 a month from some content you made a year ago, what can that do for you? That's rent! (sorry for those folks that live in The Bay or NYC lol, you gotta work a little harder 😉) It could be the difference between staying in a gig that you hate and taking a position you truly love with an organization that can't afford talent of your caliber.

That's pretty cool.

Publishing a course on egghead.io can start that stream of passive recurring revenue flowing. And after that one, publishing another will make the current flow stronger. One day you'll wake up and realize your day job is optional and you are working because you want to work, and not because you have to work.

Hopefully you are already in that position, but if not, we want to help you get there. We're totally obsessed, and will do everything we can to support and amplify our instructors.

**You're freaking awesome**. Period. 

We're in this to have a job that we love, work with amazing diverse people across the globe, and help the masses improve their lives by learning how to develop software.

Sound good to you?

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3v3m2i0j1k3g0p1q070z/Image%202016-09-29%20at%201.48.51%20PM.gif?v=25e3f936)

## Self-published one-off lessons

**If you have 12+ lessons published, you can approve your own content**. Pushing "approve" will order transcripts (they cost money, so please push it when the lesson is ready!) for a lesson and move it to the "publishing queue". Lessons are published from this queue automatically every m-w-f. You will be shown a "publish" button as well, so you can publish your stuff whenever you want. 

The one-off lessons is a **great** way to build your catalog, see a little revenue, and keep your screen-casting muscles strong in between courses.

The expectation here is that you will create lessons that follow the egghead.io standards outlined in [the Instructor Guide](https://instructor.egghead.io). Give them good names, summaries, tags, and code samples. As control freaks, this is a big step for us 😂, but we trust you to publish your best. Feel free to [ask for feedback in the instructor channel on egghead.io Slack](https://eggheadio.slack.com/archives/egghead-instructors).

![with great power](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1X3d0U2x2I3Y060s1s0B/Image%202016-09-29%20at%204.44.02%20PM.gif?v=def0754b)

Courses require [the proposal/approval process](https://instructor.egghead.io/03-creating-courses/create-courses.html), but if you publish a bunch of one-offs and decide that they would make a great course later? Let's talk about it!

We're brainstorming a list of courses we'd love to see created, and will hopefully have time to create basic proposals for some of them too. When this happens, We'll let everybody know on Slack. 

# Contracts

We've got a [standard contributor agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jNT6R6SNb9OVYSnpTDqevMh80XZ8Gu3VeYoLZck0v4/edit?usp=sharing) that we supply to all instructors. The goal of the agreement is protect egghead from any mischief you might cause, leave **all ownership rights** to you the creator, and lay out the terms for payment.

We use DocuSign for electronic signatures for these agreements. When the time comes, the agreement will be delivered to your email address for your signature.


# Creating an egghead lesson

To get published, your lesson needs to be "in the style of egghead.io". This is what we need to deconstruct so that we can understand exactly what that means.



## What's an egghead lesson?

A great lesson requires two things:

* a desire to share knowledge
* the patience to learn the process

**We aren't looking for new/novel/exciting ways to present and teach**. 

*egghead.io style* is to record your screen and walk a collegue through a concept or feature. We don't use fancy video editing tricks or transitions beyond simply cutting out empty space, mistakes, and excessive "ummm"s and making sure the audio gain is at a consistent level.

You can think about an egghead lesson like calling a coworker over to your desk to show them something cool that you just learned. Would you make a slide deck for them? Would you use star-dissolve transitions? Probably not!

We aren't looking for that either. We want to see concise efficient knowledge transfer that respects **your** time, and the time of the student as well. Nothing fancy. We don't want fancy, we want badass. That's you. Teach us what you know.

### Three Pillars of egghead

#### Respect the audience

Developers are busy people. We bet that you are a busy person, with lots going on personally and professionally. We have limited time to learn and teach, and often we learn because of an impending deadline. We don't have time to waste, and when a developer is watching an egghead video, they expect it to be concise, on target, and useful for their current situation.

We want to deliver a well titled lesson that contains what the viewer will expect without a lot of surprise. A lesson called "creating routes in Express" shouldn't diverge and discuss a whiz-bang D3.js pie chart that also happens to be in the example.

Have you ever been to a conference or user group talk, and left slightly confused when the talk was over and wasn't what you were expecting? Was the title misleading? Maybe it was "link bait"? We don't want to surprise people that way. Your title and description for lessons will inform the viewer what to expect. Stick to that!

We also don't need to spend time with formalities like greetings or personal introductions. It seems like a good idea, but most users are watching several videos. Do you say "hello my name is Kim" every 3 minutes when talking to a co-worker? 😳

Probably not. We can drop the "hello" and the "good bye" entirely. It's not rude, we promise.

Be sure to **show your work**. Show what you are doing. Use the mouse to guide the viewers eye around the screen as you explain the topic of the lesson. Make sure the **code** you are discussing is front and center. People code along to these, so consider that and make it easier for them to follow along.

#### You're the hero!

You're smart and know a lot of stuff. Did you always know all of the things? Nope. Can you remember any "aha!" moments in your own journey? Any particular author, blogger, or screen caster that has helped you? What was good about their content, and how can you pass that gift of knowledge along?

**Capture the "AHA!" moment** by showing the moment leading up to and directly after that point in time.

Another example is when a tough Google search lands you on a Stack Overflow question that matches the problem you are having right now. That well-constructed answer that is thorough, thoughtful, and comprehensive. The author of the answer is a **hero** in that moment.

You can **be that hero** to somebody else with your thorough, honest answer!

#### Do the Work

The number one key to success in teaching people to code better via screencasts is simply **hitting the f'n record button** and explaining the thing. It can be uncomfortable at first. It can even feel a lot like stage fright, but the sooner you start recording, the sooner we will be pushing the "publish" button on your first egghead course.

Your first lesson will probably stink. It's a fact, and it is totally fine. Send it to your mentor for feedback, and they will get you on track.

Your time is **valuable** too. Don't waste it trying to figure everything out on your own. You've got your mentor, the egghead team, and dozens of fellow instructors willing and able to help you achieve success.

We are here to help, and happy to do it!

## The Lesson Context

Teaching anything can be challenging. 

Where do we start? 
What can we assume the student knows? 

We can't teach everything.

Watch this video, as it represents the core of what an egghead lesson is:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CT_OJZCYncA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video doesn't explain "why?" you might need a Cheesecake-Stuffed Cookie Cake. It **jumps right in** and shows us step one. There are infinite varieties of reasons we might need a Cheesecake-Stuffed Cookie Cake. Maybe we have a party to attend. Maybe it's for dessert after dinner. Maybe we are sad and are prepping a Breaking Bad binge watching session and need a little something to snack on. Who knows? The less assumptions the video makes, the better.

It also doesn't tell you why you need cream cheese, sugar, cookie dough, a mixer, a bowl, a pie plate, an oven... We can assume that the instructions are accurate, because there is a certain amount of trust. We definitely need to have a basic understanding of what these ingredients are, but imagine a world where YouTube videos explained first principles of every ingredient. That would suck. If the video is over our heads - "wait, what is that spinning device that is agitating all of the ingredients?!?!" - it's on the student to take a pause and do a bit of research.

The text description is also an excellent location to provide additional context and references. Links to purchase ingredients, tools, or to learn prerequisites such as measuring and using an electric mixer.

## **Your** voice.

Right now you're reading a document that describes in some detail how you should create egghead.io lessons. It's a style guide, and consistent style is important.

_Your voice is more important._

This style guide is not intended to stifle your voice. We want you to be you! What this means in a practical sense is that you can consider your egghead.io lessons to be a conversation with a co-worker at your desk or over a screenshare. We just want that tightened up, like we've got all the pleasentries out of the way and let's get to the point of the conversation.

## Why are we here?

Who knows! We know that the student wants to learn. We want to teach. They likely have a specific problem they are trying to solve. They are probably using multiple resources to build knowledge, and if we've done our job with solid titles and descriptions we can have a good idea of what it is they want to learn about.

Context can dig into the "why?" of what we are doing. The problem with the question "why?" is that it is ultimately a philosophical question, and requires a pile of unknowns to be answered before you can really get to the heart of "why?"

Often as instructors we will try to build up context in the form of an example. We might avoid "boring" examples like TodoMVC or other simple understood examples in favor of a more complex "real-world" example. Complex examples can be interesting. Deconstructing a "full production boilerplate" is always an interesting and informative exercise. The struggle with the complex example is the instructor now has the burden of explaining the context of the example. Throughout the lesson or course, the person learning has the additional cognitive weight of understanding the example and how everything functions together to meet the requirements of the example.

This is why the TodoMVC project is so popular. We don't need to think about the example domain, just how all of the parts are wired together. It makes for an awesome tool for exploring libraries, frameworks, and languages because it implements the same requirements over and over again. We don't need to discuss what TodoMVC is, we can just learn.

Does this mean that all egghead.io lessons are TodoMVC? No, we aren't going to do that to you, but simple examples should be preferred. We aren't trying to be particularly clever with the examples. Less is more. Keep it simple. Focus on the concepts and make the example as small of a distraction as is possible.

## Show, don't tell.

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3h2n1W1S2v0l0O1j1i1g/Image%202016-08-08%20at%2011.09.20%20AM.png?v=61cfc933)

Which side of this picture looks like the more engaging way to really learn how to build a bird house? On the right you have what is arguably the better bird house. It's awesome. Look at those fillets! Amazing.

On the left you have a mentor. A friendly guide that shows you how to build a perfectly adequate birdhouse. One that is totally possible with your bird house construction skill levels (not much), and equally as awesome as the fancy birdhouse on the right. You built it with your own two hands, and learned a bunch of new skills!

## Greetings and salutations!

egghead.io lessons are concise. Generally speaking, people are going to watch more than one lesson. Greeting them and wishing them farewell is not adding anything to their experience. 

Please don't greet the student, introduce yourself, talk about past lessons, talk about future lessons, plug your podcast, or anything that isn't core to the lesson.

Just start doing. Start showing. You can recap the lesson at the end if you like, but keep it short and just nail the key points and then just stop! Make them yearn for more.

## Time and space.

Now. Stay in it.

As much as possible try to avoid referencing other lessons. "In the next lesson..." or "In the previous lesson..." should be avoided. An egghead.io lesson should be as self-contained as possible, teaching a concept. The lesson will be surrounded by context in the form of a list of related lessons, a title, a text description with helpful links.

If you do need to reference a prerequisite lesson, link to it in the description!

## You are the expert. Instruct.

Instructors are here to instruct. People come to egghead.io lessons and courses ready to be told what they need to do. We aren't making a sales pitch trying to convince them that we are correct and the technology is right for them. We are instructing them on how to do something, how to accomplish a task.

We are going to demonstrate how use a feature or concept by **showing** instead of telling. 

![how to wash your hands](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/163A1x3y1Z032V182t3q/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-19%20at%2010.45.22%20AM.png?v=1b78061e)

Being concise often means adjusting how we approach the language we use. An egghead.io lesson attempts to be concise. This often means that we want to favor an active vs passive voice in how we deliver instruction.

> Hello, before we get started using Webpack you are going to need to install node. We are going to visit this URL and find the link to install it. Now we press "download" and we should get a file. We can now open that file and extract it's contents. Now that node is installed we can use npm to install webpack globally. Great, now that webpack is installed globally we can use it! Open up Sublime or your favorite editor to start working on the config.

_vs._

> We've got node already installed. Use npm to install webpack. Now run init and open the config to edit it.

We don't have to explain or justify the each step in the instruction. We can assume that we are delivering content to smart, capable humans that can fill in some blanks.

## The soul of an egghead.io lesson.

An egghead lesson is a precise discussion of a single topic. It stands alone. It has no side effects. It is like a *pure function*.

We want the student to walk away with a better understanding of concept the lesson is focused on. We want to increase their vocabulary and show them a solid high quality example.

We put together [this playlist of lessons that fit the bill](https://egghead.io/playlists/great-lessons-1cb62cb4). They are all different, but great in their own right. We aren't here to cramp **your** style, but we want to collaborate and present your style and your knowledge in the egghead way.

# The Lesson Concept

> I can't think of anything to record! :cry:

This is normal! It's like writer's block. You are staring at a blank canvas of infinite possibilities. We need to take that first stroke and get the ball rolling. In many ways, you can look at a screencast lesson as a blog post or short article.

It's also totally possible that looking at it like a blog post or short article won't help at all!

So let's take a look at what an "idea" is, and what we need to conjure up to create an awesome lesson on egghead.io

## What makes a great lesson?

Well, first off, we are looking for **practical** lessons that help people perform real work. We want to ensure that we are respecting their time, and providing an answer to something specific in a concise way.

Three things that clearly let us know the strength of a lesson, before any video has even been recorded are:

* The example
* The title
* The summary

### The example

The example is the foundation that a good lesson is built on. A good example is simple, and doesn't require in depth knowledge of a specific domain. The example should be easy to run with very few simple steps. We want the example to run in Plunkr or JS Bin where at all possible, to give the viewer the most immediate ability to edit and play.

A good example might contain many lessons to fully describe, but an example of the right size won't get bogged down in the day to day repetition of create a "real-world" application. Keep it simple!

There are several places to mine for ideas. 

* Open Source Projects - if you work on an open source project, contribute to one, or even just have a favorite open source tool, this is often a great place to choose a theme for a lesson.
* Stack Overflow - this is a **trove** of pain from which to develop useful examples. A [quick search](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5bjavascript%5d%20react) reveals questions and answers that would make excellent egghead lesson topics.
* Your own education - are you learning something cool right now? The best way to solidify what you learn is to teach!

You can make assumptions about what the viewers of your lesson will already know. We can jump ahead a bit, and not explain all of the fine details regarding setup. We can assume that a README will be provided that gets the user up and running quickly.

The obvious exception here is when the lesson is focused on the setup itself. In this case, the design of the example will highlight the process or tool that you are trying to teach.

**Don't worry if some egghead lesson exists or not.** This is not a blocker. We don't mind content that covers the same topic or subject.

> Boy, egghead.io sure has too many lessons on the fundamentals of React!

This was said by _nobody, ever_. We promise. We firmly believe that hard topics need the fundamentals covered by good examples. A lot of them. It helps people learn!

### A strong title is key!

The first thing you need to do is consider the topic that you want to teach. It's important to keep in mind what an egghead lesson is.

Concise.

We strive to teach one thing very clearly in a short amount of time.

#### How do I...?

A great trick to creating a strong title is to say "How do I...?" in your head and then write the title.

[how do I...] Debug Angular Applications with Chrome DevTools

This clearly defines the scope of the lesson, and also informs the student as to what they will be watching. If you consider google and Stack Overflow (and you should!), this is how people use those tools. We type keywords related to some "how do I...?" question into Google, and (hopefully) find enlightenment with the results. 

You definitely want your lesson to show up in the results!

### Clearly summarize the lessons

Now that you've got a great title, you need to write a clear concise summary describing:

* the problem/pain we will solve
* how we will solve it

You are giving away the ending in the summary! It **should** be a spoiler that explains what we are about to learn. If it is too long or requires a lot of detail to summarize coherently, perhaps the lesson scope needs to be reduced.

## How short should my lessons be?

When we talk about "bite-sized" lessons, we don't mean strictly length. Some topics require some extra time to clearly explain. We aren't aiming for a specific duration target.

The goal with an egghead lesson is to clearly present a concept.

Be concise. Remove cruft.

Single purpose lessons with no distractions.

We've found that most things can be explained in under 10 minutes.

### "10 minutes?!? Monads will take me days to explain!"

Complex topics are generally composed of many smaller solutions/concepts. We break a thing down into small atoms of information, combining them to create something more than the sum of its parts.

For some topics, it is hard to explain them without the context of a course. We will talk about that later, as it is vital and important. We combine bite-sized lessons together to make bite-sized courses. Some egghead courses are only 10 minutes long, but convey a ton of information.

If you're recording a stand-alone lesson, find the core concept and stick to it.

## Is this already covered on egghead.io?

Here's a secret...it doesn't matter if it is already covered on egghead.io. It is **very likely** that your perspective will be interesting and will serve to help somebody. "egghead sure has too many awesome videos on doing ___________. What's up with that?" <- this is not something we are too worried about hearing!

## I'm just learning!

This is fantastic. It is impossible to regain the "true beginner" perspective. Once you've seen the answer, it can't be unseen. Taking what you are learning and turning it into lessons for others will save them time and provide immense value.

What **you** are learning is what you should be teaching. That's what we want to hear about.

There are no bad topics.

*There are no topics that are too simple.*

[Let's talk about it](https://eggheadio.slack.com/messages/egghead-lesson-ideas/)!

## Recording High-Quality Coding Screencasts

This is the nuts and bolts of what we do at egghead.io. We sit down, prepare our screens, and record complicated technical concepts to share with other developers around the world.

Screencasting is not easy. It's freaking hard, actually. It is a learned skill that takes consistent practice over time.

To top it off, we are very picky about our screencasts that we publish on egghead.io!

We want screencasts that are top notch, and provide a baseline level of quality to the user. We want them to share a sameness in terms of quality and presentation.

This doesn't mean we want you to not be you. On the contrary, we want your style to flourish and be ever present in your egghead.io lessons.

This is about mechanics! The technical aspects of presentation and accessibility. Our goal is to present lessons that are clear and provide the maximum clarity and visibility. Video by nature is a restrictive format. We have to consider a wide range of people that will want to view this content.

If we maximize the legibility of the code we are presenting, it will help all learners to absorb the information to the best of their abilities.

Small fonts, blurry text, and low-contrast color schemes all distract and distract the user from the primary object: learning.

### The Code

⚡️ **The code is the champion of an egghead.io screencast**.

To that end, it deserves **maximum** horizontal space. It is a good idea to use an 80 or 120 character "column" for the code and bump the font size up to fit.

We will typically work in a 3 column layout, with the editor taking up 2/3s and a browser on the right side in the remaining 1/3 of the screen. You might prefer to flip back and forth between the browser and the editor, it is up to you.

It is important to keep in mind that some padding allowances should be considered for the top and bottom of the recording window, as they can get cut off by player chrome. For instance, if you're recording the terminal, commands towards the bottom might not be visible, and this can be frustrating/distracting.

#### Plunker for web examples when possible
Your development environment, text editor, and output for recording are up to you. When possible we want to use Plunker to embed code alongside the lessons. Each lesson will have the completed code solution presented in the video!

For `console` output examples, [here is a Plunk](https://embed.plnkr.co/github/bclinkinbeard/egghead-d3v4/03-time-scales?show=src%2Fapp.js,preview) that demonstrates how to do that simply with JS by overriding `console.log`

#### Github for more complex examples
Sometimes we can't embed the code in a working fashion. This is true for examples that are part of larger applications that leverage webpack or something similar, or for examples that aren't web based at all. In these cases we prefer Github.

Github examples should **include a README** that explains how to run them and use appropriate `npm` scripts for idiomatic usage.

#### Fallback!

If it just wont work in Plunker we also support JSBin and CodePen. We also allow you to just paste in some markdown.

### Resolution

* 1280x720 (720p)
* 16:9 Aspect Ratio
* Stereo audio

We deliver content at 720p (1280x720 in pixels). We want this to be a crisp and legible output for the user. We want egghead.io lessons to present well when expanded fullscreen on a 65" TV screen or watched on the bus on a phone.

⚡️ **For best results, we use HiDPI mode on our monitors.**

HiDPI mode is also known as Retina Display on macs or DPI scaling more broadly. This allows us to view very high resolutions with readable text, by effectively doubling each pixel.

![retina image comparison](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1K0v27373N2s0N3O0N1B/Image%202016-09-18%20at%202.27.08%20PM.png?v=aebac42f)


_image from [designmodo.com](http://designmodo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/retinaComparison.png)_

#### DPI Scaling on Windows

_we need to research Windows better!_

[This article](http://www.eizoglobal.com/support/compatibility/dpi_scaling_settings_windows/) discusses pixel scaling on Windows. We've also had success just boosting the code fonts up to really max out the screen. Aspect ratio is key here, so set your screen to the highest 16x9 resolution and kick the fonts up.

Using DPI scaling features is nice because you can scale the OS chrome and make UI more legible.

#### HiDPI Mode on macOS

On Mac, we've gotten the best results when we record at **1280x720(HiDPI)** mode, giving an effective visible resolution of 1280x720, but **extremely** crisp. This resolution is achievable on 27" monitors and retina MBPs.

It's "hidden" by default, and the easiest way to achieve this resolution on a mac is with a software tool that exposes the option.

To enable HiDPI, we use the [RDM tool](https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM). On retina MacBooks, this "just works". For external monitors, or non-retina Macs, you can follow [these instructions to enable HiDPI mode](http://cocoamanifest.net/articles/2013/01/turn-on-hidpi-retina-mode-on-an-ordinary-mac.html).

![hidpi mode with RDM tool](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1b3t3O1p1k3s2w171104/slack-imgs.com.png)

Using HiDPI mode gives an extremely crisp final product that looks fantastic (readable) on phones and tablets.

Another application that works well is [SwitchRezX](http://www.madrau.com/srx_download/download.html). It's shareware and requires a fee if it is useful.

If you can't use this mode, recording at normal 1280x720 or 2560x1440 are a decent substitute. By constraining to this small window, you are able to fill the screen effectively for coding screencasts. The **most import thing to get correct** is the aspect ratio. We don't want to present with any black bars around the screen. We want to give the user maximum code visibility at all times.

### Screen Layout

It's important to give the person learning easy access to what we are trying to teach. Since we are using video, we want the text to be as clear and legible as possible. People will watch these lessons on large monitors, as well as small portable screens.

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1v373g3E292w1R3N2a0K/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-18%20at%202.36.31%20PM.png?v=25796fd7)

This is the preferred structure, where we are presenting the code on the left covering 2\/3rds of the screen and the example on the right covering the other third. This will look something like:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3A44293L043D0k0q4134/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-24%20at%201.47.33%20PM.png?v=34660ab1)

Notice that the code's font size has been increased to **maximize the space** available.

The **example will be on the right**, and occupies 1\/3rd of the screen. This is something to consider when you are creating examples, as they will have to fit into that space. The example should be simple, and it is often best to use a minimally responsive layout for the example.

In some cases, the example is replaced by a terminal, or a terminal window shares the right column with the example. In this latter case, the terminal window would be on the bottom right hand section of the screen.

The most important thing to consider is **why the user is watching the lesson**. Generally, it is so they can learn about some tool or feature. They _need_ to **see the code**!

⚡️ **The code needs to be comfortable.**

Now that the screen is ready to record, we will look at how to do that on your platform.

### Capture and Editing

For video capture, on a Mac we can use ScreenFlow, Camtasia, or IShowU HD. On Windows, we stick to Camtasia. There are other tools available for those platforms, but we generally stick to these as they cover most use cases.

#### Recording Video

[ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and Camtasia both provide editing features. We tend to prefer ScreenFlow, and egghead.io instructors are all provided any software licenses you might need.

The decision on which software you use is up to you. Many instructors prefer the standalone simplicity of ScreenFlow.

* [Trevor D. Miller showing how he uses ScreenFlow in his process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51&v=9R2nl2wtB_4)
* [Joe Maddalone takes a look at editing in Screenflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nlJ_wP9dPE&index=5&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51)

You can "kick it up a notch BAM!💥" and move into more sophisticated editing technology with software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere provides some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We would recommend starting simple, and leveling-up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later.

* [Joel Hooks does voice over and editing in Premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faINApx4-4g&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51&index=2)

#### Capturing Audio Separately

There are effectively three ways that you can record your screencasts.

* Audio First, Video Second
* Video First, Audio Second
* All at once

:zap: **all of these approaches are valid.**

There are instructors that prefer each of these approaches. All at once is arguably the simplest approach, as you can just type and record the screen and don't have to think about the video and audio separately.

When you record the audio first, you can playback the audio and record video to match. On the flip side, with video recorded first you can narrate over video playback.

It can be challenging to sync and get a natural feeling with narration. Like most things, it takes practice.

#### Editing

Editing is a skill. It takes time to become proficient, and it can be tedious until then.

:zap: **ripple delete is your greatest ally!**

Here's the first YouTube tutorial Google kicks back on [ripple delete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fks7ABBnb0I).

If there is one tool you will use forever when editing video it's ripple delete.

To take full advantage of ripple delete the recommendation we give people is to **record in small sections**. Don't try to be Snoop Dogg. _You are not the 1-take dizzle my shizzle_.

Record in "paragraphs" and pause.

This recording in small pieces and pausing is effectively editing while you record.

:zap: **record high quality content bites to avoid editing hassles**

You want to avoid a situation where you are doing intense editing to move audio and video snippets around to build a quilt like final product. **This** is the most tedious thing you could do to yourself, so by recording in small paragraph bites, you can get better takes, and by pausing in between each section, you can see visibly where you need to **ripple delete** and build your final product with minimal aggravation!

You do want to go back and make sure you edit out mouth noises and excessive "um"s. If you find yourself having to edit these out, it might take some pre-thought to avoid including them in the first place.

:zap: **the easiest way to edit is to capture it well **

### Audio Equipment

Good audio starts with quality gear. You can definitely record screencasts using the built in microphone on your laptop, but we've found that our users want to have consistent high-quality audio.

We want you to sound **amazing**! Because you are.

To make this happen, we send each instructor professional grade audio recording equipment.

Once you've created a draft lesson that is _almost_ ready to be published, we will ship you a case stuffed full of audio recording toys that will have you sounding awesome in no time.

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3B3z1A0t1w333k3g0d44/the-kit.png?v=ac667563)

This kit is minimal, and comes packed in a waterproof Pelican case. The case contains:

* K&M 259 Low Tripod Microphone Stand with Boom Arm 25900-500-55
* Shure BETA 87A Microphone
* Shock Mount to attach the mic to the stand
* TASCAM US-2x2 USB Audio Interface
* 1 XLR Cable to connect the Microphone to the USB Interface
* Badass by Kathy Sierra

This setup has 2 cables and a couple of knobs to get setup. We will go through each piece individually and discuss what it is and why it is in the box.

#### Microphone Boom

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2y322s3t1z1c1L1t0E1N/Image%202016-04-19%20at%203.09.21%20PM.jpg?v=25fc2bea)

This is a stand for the mic. They come in many shapes and sizes. This is a very nice one from Germany. It is sturdy and breaks down into 2 parts for easy storage in the box. It lets us pack everything we need into this case.

#### The Microphone

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1t090h1h0E471T2I0L21/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.40.22%20PM.jpg?v=b73c834d)

Obviously an important piece of equipment! The [Shure BETA 87a mic](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-87a-vocal-microphone) is a `supercardioid` mic, which refers to how it pics up sound. It is forgiving and doesn't pick up ambient noise. Mics are interesting because you can go **very crazy** in terms of cost for marginal returns. We aren't producing NPR segments, and this mic is definitely in the "sounds very good" column. :thumbs\_up:

Positioning of the mic is important. Here are the recommendations:


![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3t2g240B2e223G1c1c3u/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-08%20at%201.37.22%20PM.png)


#### Shock Mount

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3B1c3U2a3V0O183f0s1g/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.42.25%20PM.jpg?v=5cbc664a)

This little piece connects to the boom and the microphone slides into it before being attached to the XLR cable. It will dampen any footsteps or other vibrations that might be picked up through the stand to the mic.

#### USB Audio Interface

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3F0y1N3w2y3v0V1X1O3m/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.41.32%20PM.jpg?v=4441d0b4)

This mic is built for professional audio applications and not necessarily for capturing audio on a computer. To get from the mic to the computer we need an interface that will convert XLR analog signal into 1s and 0s for the computer to store. It has an XLR input \(2 actually\) and a USB output, from the mic and to the computer, respectively.

* :zap: **The 48v power switch needs to be on!** 
* :zap: **Turn the gain up!**
* :zap: **Set to Mic/Line**



#### XLR Cable

XLR is a type of plug that is used in professional audio applications.

## Creating Courses

Courses are what people truly love to watch. Humans desire information in chunks. They want to learn a topic in depth, but at a pace that works for them.

For egghead, courses are the natural extension of the individual lesson. A course is a composed set of bite-sized lessons. The course itself should be bite-sized, covering a single topic in depth through a sequence of individual lessons.

## Lesson Autonomy

Within a course, **each individual lesson should be as autonomous as possible**, covering its own individual topic, independently from the other lessons in the course. Obviously the lessons **are** related, but that doesn't mean we can't make an effort to allow them to stand alone.

:zap:** each lesson in a course should stand on its own as much as possible**

Tightly coupling lessons to a linear sequence is something we want to avoid with egghead.io courses. A student should be able to drop into any lesson in a course and learn a concept.

> I have to provide context! The example is built step by step. The student will be confused.

This is a fair statement, but we are going to consider an alternative approach. Instead of speaking to the user about the context we will **provide context around the video within it's HTML page the user is watching it on**.

A course will include:

* a list of all the other lessons in the course

* a robust summary that can include links to pre-requisites and otehr resources

* course notes in the form of a gitbook the community can build together

* an "enhanced transcript" that assembles all of the transcripts for a course into a usable document that allows the user to read the entire course as a book
* the code is provided with each lesson representing its current state and has a readme describing how to execute the code if it isn't in a Plunker
* individual lesson summaries with links, etc...

If you consider this context that the user is supplied, it makes the automous course within a lesson much easier to realize. We don't have to provide audio describing the context. Avoid saying "in the previous lesson" or "in a future lesson" - just get right into the concept of the lesson you are currently teaching! It makes a much nicer course that is more concise and allows for modular learning with minimal confusion.

## Course Styles

egghead.io courses have several styles. The most important aspects of a course are focus and high quality examples. If you have those two things, the style doesn't matter. It definitely helps to have a plan though, and the following are excellent places to start.

* **Documentation**: This is straight forward presentation of the documentation for a library, framework, or tool. Dan Abramov's [popular course on Redux is a good example of this](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux). This doesn't mean you should simply read the docs to the student. Instead take the docs and present them with high quality examples.

* **Project Based**: Another favorite is a project based approach. In this case we start with a project that the student will build from start to finish. John Lindquist has [done this with his Time Machine example app](https://egghead.io/courses/building-a-time-machine-with-angular-2-and-rxjs) using Angualr 2 and ngrx\/store.

* **Cookbook**: You can also present a series of problems and solutions in the "cookbook" style. A typical recipe will include some common \(or maybe not so common\) problem, and then provide an example solution for the problem using the tool the cookbook is discussing. Trevor D. Miller's [React Testing Cookbook](https://egghead.io/courses/react-testing-cookbook) is a solid example of this approach.

* **???**: You're smart and creative, and definitely not limited to any of the above. If you've got an idea, let's hear it!



## The Course Proposal

For every egghead course we request \(and require\) a written proposal before the course starts production. We ask for proposals for several reasons. To make sure a course is solid, and delivers a ton of value to your students making the proposal lets us think more deeply about the content and structure of the course. This approach allows us to define the intent of the course, as well as craft [great titles](/02-creating-lessons/ideas.md) for the course and its lessons.

[Here is an example of a course proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goXtI_zmSfXTgaimrxIss356DoedPRt5MMAySs1f-bE/edit), and here's [a blank template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5_UehD9mM2jeCtlqEZFy3epDLLmbgBBGCow5fDRNCc/edit#) for you to use.

**We strongly prefer to use Google Docs for proposals to facilitate collaboration! **The document should be shared with your mentor and other reviewers for feedback.

The proposal consists of 4 parts:

* User Story
* Goals
* Summary
* List of Lessons

We'll take a look at each of these parts in more detail.

### The User Story

At the top of the course proposal is a "user story". This is similar to the agile software practice of writing a story to describe **who**, **what**, and **why** we are creating this thing.

> As a _developer_, I want to build applications with React and Redux so that I can create applications that aren't littered with state.

### Goals

The second section of the course proposal consists of a list of goals for the course. What are we trying to teach? Why are we teaching it? What knowledge should the student walk away with?

### Summary

The course summary is a paragraph or two that describes the course, goals, technology, etc. This will generally be preseneted with the course on the website, so it should keep that in mind.

### Lesson List

Finally, we have the actual list of lessons that will be in the course. The list consists of **lesson titles and summaries** for each individual lesson. The title should follow [the "how do I..." format](/how-do-i), and the summary should summarize the goals and technology that the student will learn about in the lesson.

## The Examples

Often a course has an example that is used as a connecting thread through each lesson. Course examples should be built as soon as possible and shared for discussion. Depending on the style of the course, different example formats are more appropriate for different styles. When possible, we want to use a tool like Plunker for creating and delivering our examples. It is awesome to get the user into the code as soon as possible.

For each lesson in a course, the example will be provided in the **finished state of the lesson**.

Often it just isn't feasible for the example to be delivered in a Plunk. In those cases, we will generally prefer to use a Github repository to store the example code. Github repo examples will provide a **branch for each lesson**, where the branch is the completed state of the given lesson. If your course is the "cookbook" style and uses Github, you can just have folders in a single repo for each example.

## Recording the Course

With the prep you've done above, a lot of the hard work is done for creating a course. You can iterate on paper and build a solid curriculmn that will be useful for thousands of developers for years to come. Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved, you can start recording the lessons and uploading them as you finished.

If you haven't, we recommend you read [the section on creating lessons](/02-creating-lessons/create-lessons.md) to get more details on recording screencasts. A course is a series of lessons, recorded one by one. It's like stacking bricks.

## Maintaining the Course

"JavaScript Fatigue"

You've probably heard of this. Well, it affects egghead.io courses. Video is a tough format, and because libraries move at a brisk pace and forward progress is always happening, we are presented with some specific challenges in terms of keeping courses up to date and usable.

We make a very strong effort to keep your course as viable as possible for as long as possible.

There is a team working every day to review egghead.io courses and make sure that the code and examples are current and still work. The review team reviews the lessons on egghead.io, and makes sure that they still function with the latest versions of the tools described in the lessons. They update the code and attach version labels to help students understand the differences between the lesson video and the code.

This approach is very effective! There are times, however, where courses need to be updated. The review team will monitor and inform you of this when it occurs. We also tend to see a lot of questions and support requests around courses that have become out of date. In some circumstances, courses that aren't updated get retired.

It's in your best interest to keep your course updated when needed! It's a pain, but if you do the math, it is completely worth it.
